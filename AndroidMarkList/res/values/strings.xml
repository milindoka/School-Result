		 <li>To print marklist, install MRK.exe on any linux version in WINE. If you are in India, I would like
		  you to use it on BOSS (www.bosslinux.in), the Indianized version of Linux, even though it works on Windows PC. 
	       Transfer .mrk file to pc and double click the file to print.
	      </li>
	      <li>To bulk print marklists, keep all the files in MRK.exe folder and
		  run MRK.exe. 
		  </li>
		  <li>To modify .mrk file on PC, use Marklist.jar.
		  </li>  
	      <li>MRKreport.exe will print table of all files kept in MRKreport.exe folder with page totals.
	     </li>
	     <li>You can use open source Thunderbird pop client with addon - Attachment Extracter - to auto-collect all marklist
	         in one folder where MRK.exe is kept and bulk print them.
	      </li> 
	       <li>You can also use Dukto (FOSS) or any other file transfer app to send .mrk files from Android to PC
	       </li>
	       <li>MRKaccumulater.jar will make a compilation of all marklist files in one single text file Result.rlt.
	        It is easy to prepare and print result sheets (Progress Cards) from this compilation if you have little programming knowledge.
	        </li>
	        <li>MRKaccumulator.jar can also make mySQL database file if you have Local Server WAMP or XAMPP installed.
	         This database can be used to Upload the data on the Website of School or College
