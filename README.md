# School-Result
A Fully Automatic System To Keep Progress Of Students
This project is a group of small java applications, one Android Application and a php script for web site. These utilities create,maintains and display these records on website and ultimately print progress cards in the end of academic year
Teachers use an android app to record students progress in individual subjects lists and send them to a process department in the institution via email, telegram or any other means of file sharing.
The associated java app can print these records in tabulated form. The compiler program makes a compilation of the data and also gives mySql database for school website.
This system is specially designed for Indian School Curriculum and especially in the state of Maharashtra.
The project is implemented in my own school/college and to be adopted in about 10 schools and colleges in Mumbai, India.
The android app is available at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.refort.MarkList&hl=en 

At present it is uploaded at https://sourceforge.net/projects/marklist/
I am importing it slowly to GIT
I hope it will be useful to other schools and colleges.
